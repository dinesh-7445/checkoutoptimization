#OnePage Checkout for ViraXpress

The **OnePage Checkout for ViraXpress** is specifically designed as an integrated feature of the **ViraXpress**. It is not a standalone extension and cannot function independently with any Magento 2 installation. Instead, it is specifically designed to work seamlessly within the ViraXpress, delivering an enhanced, user-friendly checkout experience tailored to this unique setup.

#### Features
- Optimized for ViraXpress
The OnePage Checkout is fully compatible with the ViraXpress/Frontend theme, ensuring smooth functionality and performance.
- Fallback Configuration
For scenarios where certain payment gateways are not supported, you can leverage the fallback configuration. This allows you to revert to the default **Luma theme** for the checkout process, ensuring flexibility and continuity.
